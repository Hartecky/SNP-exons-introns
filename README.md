## Project Description: 

A Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) polymorphism is a mutation of genetic material that involves the exchange of one nucleotide for another nucleotide. The presence of SNP may cause a change in the sequence of the encoded protein, or change the expression of genes, which in turn may result in a change of the phenotype. 


All known polymorphisms in Arabidopsis thaliana were downloaded from the EnsemblPlants database (in the VCF format file). Additionally, annotations containing their identificators and coordinates as well as exon coordinates were downloaded (in the GFF format file). 


The main aim of the project was to describe the genetic variability in an Arabidopsis thaliana, in terms of single nucleotide polymorphisms and also to indicate their location in the genome with a functional context. 


Next approach was to identify the SNPs contained in the protein coding sequences, along with determining their frequency and indicating whether there was a significant difference in the number of SNPs between the exons.
